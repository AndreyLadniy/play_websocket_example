		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>
			With this template, you'll get a full working application that uses
			both stateless and statefull AKKA actors.<br> You can send and
			receive single to server, single to broadcast, server to broadcast
			messages. The statefull example will show you a very simple and yet
			powerful implementation of websocket actors that are able to retain
			informations such as session (uuid), number of messages, and any
			other data you can send through json's format.
